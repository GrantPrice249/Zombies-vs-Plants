Zombies vs Plants

Important information
This game requires a controller to use
This game is not complete. There are many bugs and crashes that can occur. It is still a work in progress

Level mods
This game supports the addition of level mods. To add extra levels, create a folder at the location of the jar named "Levels" and add your levels. The level file needs to be the same format as a regular level file and must have a .LEVEL ending. A feature to make your own level will come soon. 
The level file formatting goes like this: 
Line 1 (integer): level difficulty
Line 2 (integer): Line location
Line 3-9 (integer): Plant list
Line 10: Should be -1 to end file

This game has a plant AI, but also supports multiplayer. Connecting another controller before starting the game will disable the AI and enable multiplayer
